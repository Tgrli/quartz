Mythril is a AI powered [[world building]] game 

Some men want fame some want power. All I want is to play a game that's productive. A game that spits out a valuable thing for me. After the long campaign is over.

I want to synch time into a game and look at my mom in the eyes and say yes I played games all day with out talking to anyone. And guess what and I'm so proud of what I made.

There's nothing like available to me, so I must build it. For the rest of this essay I will convince you that not only building a game like this is possible. But also is solving one of the biggest problem for humanity.

So why is that important? Why is that interesting? Actually just not long ago, one of my best friends, Patrick, he's an artist, he really likes playing games, he draws visuals, and he likes to think about things, fun guy, been around him since high school, decades long friendship, he was basically making some kind of comment about gaming being productive, and in my mind I'm like, gaming is not productive.

He was like, why? I was like, because to be productive, by definition, you need to be producing something, and you're not really producing anything that other people could use when you are playing a game, a video game. And then I thought again, maybe you can, maybe if you gamify interactions of a software so that it is interesting and it provides immediate feedback that triggers your dopamine, you could actually create a deliverable, a product in the end, for someone else to enjoy.

And also here's the other thing, the reason why I want this is because nowadays so many platforms and forms of media and entertainment, no matter movies, TV shows, games, books, every form of media and entertainment, it is a consumption-based thing. Not that it's bad, it's just is. That's the case right now.

I'm a firm believer that if you love a certain medium enough, and you enjoy a certain genre enough, and when you consume enough, the natural instinct is to create it. At least that is the case for me. I love playing games.

I've built games before. They're cool games, but not very good. They're good games, but not very great games.

I like to read non-fiction. I would like to someday write non-fiction about my own insights and worldviews that I hope could be helpful to somebody. I love watching anime and watching movies and immersing myself in narrative universes.

I also hope to create narrative universes that other people can be infatuated by and immerse in and enjoy as much as I did. Many of my favorite genres and games and worldviews. And that's where Mithril comes in.

Here's another observation, which is text. I think text is a different medium. It's the most simple, you could say.

The most nimble, because of the small file size. But it also leaves the most room for your imagination. It's so common that, like how many times have you heard people who watch a movie or TV series that's an adaptation of a good, famous fiction or some kind of story that they've read before in the text format, and it's just a huge disappointment for them.

They say the world's archaic, they didn't do the book justice, they didn't... I think no matter what, no matter how good a media adaptation of a text format is, it's ultimately not as fantastical as your own mind, as the way that you imagined it, because that's the way you want it. So it's always going to be a disappointment if you're infatuated with the text format first.

So, and I've been trying to think of a way to build out what I call the narrative stack, the bottom layer of the narrative stack, which I think is text. It's text-based narrative universes, world-building, and character creation, and that's what Mithril will enable. And on top of that, which is the advent of AI, since I worked on a due diligence tool for investment firms for a while, I got decent at using large-length models and AI and projecting them and having a good feel for what they could do and what they're capable of and understanding their limitations and strengths.

So one thing that really challenged us when we were building out this due diligence large-length model is that no matter how delicately you prompt it, no matter how well you select for the training data to fine-tune the large-length model, it always hallucinates. And the issue with a due diligence product that hallucinates is that it's inaccurate. And inaccuracy is not tolerated.

And fundamentally, we couldn't really fix this problem, so I couldn't be intellectually honest enough to sell it. And also, when I get feedback, I can't, like, full-heartedly tell myself that the feedback I'm getting is the most important problem to solve. And also, since we are not the users ourselves, it's really hard to have a fast feedback and iteration loop.

So yeah, I'm rambling on towards the old product, but anyways, what we found as a problem before in this project, in this role, it's actually a strong suit. We don't need an AI to be accurate in this one. If it hallucinates, sure, it's just some randomness in the story.

And with the admin of agents, each agent could be designed as a character that could be put in a worldview, and you can make them organically interact with each other, and make decisions for themselves, and let their paths cross or not. And this is where I think the hardest part, and I haven't figured out yet what this whole project is, which is, what is the interaction paradigm as a human in the loop for this story building structure? I think in terms of world building, how their interaction flow might be, it could be something like a basic survey type of thing, except it will be read out by an AI text-to-voice, like a high-fidelity text-to-voice, something like an 11 Labs voice.

And it will just ask you what your favorite genres are, and what you liked about them, how did those genres make you feel, and it would probably be a good basis for the type of world that you want to create. So I have this idea of reverse prompting, so that's when the machine prompts the human being and triggers thought, internal thought within the human brain that's valuable. I feel like the AI industry right now has too far a focus on how much value we can get out of the AI, instead of having a focus on how an AI can get an interesting thought process started within ourselves.

And I think that's what this world building workflow can harness. And that comes to the next thing, which is I really like Brian Orgard's idea about the no-mind consumer product. It says that every widely adopted consumer entertainment media format, from the TV onwards, it's a passive consumption.

So basically, minimal friction, people want to completely relax, not have to pay too much attention and just chew it out. And I think if that's the case, how can I make the agent interaction seamless? I think the audio is a big first step, which is nobody wants to read if that takes too much mental friction.

If you have a local model that is very, very fast in terms of generating text, something alongside of a mist scroll and a dolphin mist scroll, something like that, and then immediately start to text to voice sequence locally, that might be a short enough time latency for the user to not feel extremely disconnected from the process. So it's just a complete verbal-based thing. Ideally, they can just do it with their AirPods on without looking weird.

Because I think nowadays, if you have AirPods on, you can just talk. Hell, I'm talking in a mall with my AirPods on like a crazy man right now. But people just think I'm talking on the phone.

It's completely socially normalized, so that's not a big deal. Right. So imagine this user flow where you create a world based on a survey.

You don't have to actually do anything. Just answer the question that the AI asked you. Comes up with a world, and it comes up with three characters or two characters.

And how do you want to make these characters? You can talk about how, like what values do you value? What do you care about?

And that's the second part of this survey. And the AI would write these values into these characters, and certain characters will embody some of your values, and it might weigh them differently. And maybe it can ask you more about your favorite characters in all kinds of media.

What does the character desire? Do you desire revenge? Do you desire success?

Do you desire power? What is it that they want, basically? After those questions are answered, the AI can just start giving you ideas of what these characters are like.

And you can work with that AI to add on little details about characters' personality, perks, or their likes and dislikes. You could do that, or you could just approve and not approve. This is where I think the Brian Norgaard idea could be implemented, which is just a simple yes-no.

So, if you like the AI's decision, you say sure or yes. And if you don't, you say no, and why not? Just talk to it like a normal person, and it should be able to figure out what suits your taste.

Once there's two to three characters instantiated, and a world built out, and a couple locations set, which is a part of the world-building process, the character starts making decisions and building their stories. And with each action they take, with each thought they have, you as the human in the loop is a part of it the whole time. And you could choose to interject, change their ideas, change their thought process, like these fictional characters' thought process, and their actions.

And if you don't, you can always just approve or disapprove, or redo. Basically, approve or redo, essentially. And then the AI will come up with another thing for you until you say yes, it would not proceed.

And when it proceeds, you may be jumping to a different character. I don't know yet how this might look like. Because it depends if the two characters are starting together in the same location or not.

Maybe they meet later on in the story, like Game of Thrones. All that's very unsure at this point of the product, but I think something like this would be very interesting. Because this effectively brings down the creative needs, like the creative friction for this entire medium, which is what I call the bottom layer of the myth stack.

Just like how TikTok democratized video creation, and how Instagram democratized photo, I feel like this could democratize world building. And here's where it gets interesting. I recently read Read Write Own by Chris Dixon.

I think something like your own world is a perfect product, perfect intellectual property that can be stored on-chain. And once stored on-chain as a public database that anyone can access, the remixability, the interopability, or what's the other one, could basically go wild, is what I'm saying. You could read somebody else's story, you can remix it, you can add your own take to it, since everything's on-chain, and you can adopt it into other formats.

The thing about text is that it's so easy to add, to convert it into other formats of media. So let's take an example. I have a built-out universe of a linear story of, I don't know, mages that can access our world from a different dimension.

And the magic system in that world is similar to how code is worked out in our world. And I want to make this into a game, but I don't know how. Characters are developed, and I like MOBA, or I like RPGs, but I don't know how to make an RPG.

Someone else saw my project on-chain, but they have 10 years of RPG development experience, and they want to work on this with me. And they love my story, they read my visual novel or something, I don't know, and they want to build a game out of it, and I'll be like, great, let's do this. And imagine if there was a readily available template stack of smart contracts where all the creators in Mithril could refer to and collab on.

And once the product is released, other people can buy this product, enjoy it, collect it, and remix it at their own will. And once there's multiple people on the same project, it'll be very interesting because you could even host live sessions with AIs where both of you guys approve or disapprove a decision made by the AI, the characters, or both of you guys can have a video call or voice call that'll be totally recorded and transcribed into text and then fed into the LLM, and that would be another layer, another way of getting your human opinion into the system. I don't know, I just feel like there's really something here, and this really ties into my idea about what post-scarcity human beings might do, because I feel like there's fewer things that's as creative other than, like, creating a kid, there's few things as creatively gratifying as world-building, and making games and writing stories, and just delighting each other.

I think the human's ability to delight each other is not going to go away anytime soon. So this is kind of my project, to really instantiate my worldview and test it, if it's possible. I try to operationalize my ideas I've been reading up about on building startups, building companies, building software, and human nature.

I really want to test if my ideas are solid enough, and this is my attempt at doing that. Okay, please. Yeah, this is my voice transcript for the first draft of this essay of why I want to build Mithril, and why world-building is cool.


multiple choice is easier than Q and A. We try to algorhythmically narrow down the world building process to multiple choice.
