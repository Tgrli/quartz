Ever since learning about it college. I always had the urge to dismiss design thinking as bs. Especially after visiting the idea office multiple times. I thought of it more of a coolness booster and status symbol for very profitable companies. Like B2B LV bags.

However, nowadays, I do think it has his merits. I come to see it as another word for asking questions things as well. I guess my issue with it was always the fact that it just bundles simple ideas into a invented umbrella term to make it seem fancier than it actually is. 

Ask open ended questions and listen/document well.

Ask the right questions at the right time.

Don't be afraid to start from the beginning again.

A facilitators job is to lead a conversation that generates insights in a corporate context. So basically running a brainstorming meeting with someone who's not your boss mix in some kindergarten activities. 

At risk of sounding like a loner loser. I do this with myself on a document with a LLM and I think the results are better. 

I am a different thinker when I'm walking, at my desk in the morning, hanging out with my cat on a afternoon, having a convo with my friend. There's ways to document for yourself nowadays. And AI to string ideas together and distill synthesize. 

Time is your friend. You can compound your insights. 

Get feedack from the internet.
