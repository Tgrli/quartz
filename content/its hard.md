making a living is not hard. the formula is spend you time to do something someone else wants you to do and is willing to give you money for it.

Its hard when you add a meaning layer on top of it. Not only do i want to make money. I also want to spend my time well. And develop my self into a uniquely useful version with maximized  fun. Solving interesting problems only. And. make sure i can strategically compound on my knowledge and experience in the long run for something meaningful. Ultamatly i want to compete with nation states.  

I am improving my ability to read prossess and write. 

read includes: text, audio, video
process includes: to understand, to plan, to procedualize   
write includes: text, speaking, live performing 

the different degrees of freedom 
- time is someone else's to solve their problem, you have to be at the certain place at a certain time to do a certain thing dictated by others
- time is yours for you to spend on solving your problems 
- you don't have problems you have to solve, you have the freedom to solve the most interesting problem to you. 

im still at the middle level.
