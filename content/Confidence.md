Intellectual Confidence 

Ask LLM's these three questions about a new word and you will understand quite well. 
1. **What is the etymology of the word?**
    
    - This question helps uncover the word's origins, including the language it comes from and how its meaning has evolved over time. Understanding the etymology can provide insights into the cultural and historical contexts that shaped the word's current usage and meaning.
2. **What are the different meanings or senses of the word?**
    
    - Words often have multiple meanings or senses, including literal, figurative, connotative, and denotative meanings. Asking this question allows you to explore the full range of the word's interpretations and uses in various contexts, enhancing your understanding of its versatility and nuances.
3. **How is the word used in different contexts?**
    
    - This involves examining the word's role in syntax (its part of speech) and semantics (its meaning) across different sentences, genres, and discourse communities. Understanding the usage includes knowing in which contexts the word is appropriate, how it interacts with other words, and any idiomatic expressions it may be part of. This question also encourages exploration of the word in spoken and written forms, in professional, casual, and domain-specific contexts.
Start with these and naturally flow towards other questions. 

Tolerating Mental friction of long form information. Finding your favorite long form medium. I believe for myself and most people audio is more digestible than text. Evolutionarily were evolved to pass out information through language. Text was invented not long ago.

When I can, I try to look at text while I listen. So visual plus auditory when it's possible. I used to use speechify. But it's so expensive. And I found a way to do it for free with Apple devices. The voices are just as good if not better and native to the ecosystem so it's snappier and faster. (make a youtube vid about it)

Audio is my favorite format because AirPods. The second most important invention from Apple. Right below the iPhone. I love listening to books and podcast when I'm working out or commuting. building this habit has made the biggest contribution in compounding my knowledge base.
