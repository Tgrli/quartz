### Childhood 
Born in northern China. Yes I have Commie grand parents. Moved to Canada with my mom when I was 3. Bought the whole Santa Claus thing. Started to dream talk in english. Parents don't want me to lose the Chinese language so moved back to my home town in china at 7. Went to public school in China for 7 years. Learned that teachers could beat kids and how to make a buck at the yearly young pioneer exchange market hosted by the school.
### Teenage Years 
Went to a Canadian public high school alone at 13 living with a relative. Felt extremely out of place. I spoke native sounding english without getting any cultural context. Played competitive golf so mom and dad can love me more. Did not join team sports. Favorite pastime was to smoke listen to music and podcasts (Joe Rogan was basically my dad) and go on photography hikes with three of my best buds. Discovered J Cole, Kanye West and Drake. Decided black American culture is the coolest. 

Tried to check boxes for American colleges. Early Decision for NYU.
### College
Decided to go to the Shanghai Campus for the booming digital economy. I was dazzled by the lights, buildings and newness. Introduced to code and design. Went clubbing a lot. Did as many different interns as possible to MVP my way to finding a career. Toured the country as a photographer videographer with the number one DJ at the time. (Private equity at this big dick Chinese fund, Ernst and Young "Innovation" Center, Marketing, Advertising, E-commerce, Insure tech start up in New York) But I didn't want to be my boss at any of the jobs at worked at when I'm their age. Entrepreneur dream seeded. Senior year made a VR game. Built and implemented a VR co-design workflow for a interior design and construction company. 

### Covid 
2020 Tried to be a day trader. Loved the independent nature of it. Sucked at being a day trader but decent at swing trades and investments. Got obsessed with investors. Started reading. 

### Now 
I don't know if Im on track to become a formidable founder or Im a loser working on a DIY project at home.
