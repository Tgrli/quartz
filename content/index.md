Hey there. I'm Kyan.
My exotic ethnic name sounds exactly like cayenne.  Like the pepper and the porsche. I care a lot about technology, living in flow state and good art. I am always obsessed with a person or an idea at all times and reading up about it. As I learn, it seems like all roads lead to building. I think good ideas are the most important things in the entire universe.
