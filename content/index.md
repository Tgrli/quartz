Hey there. I'm Kyan.
My exotic ethnic name sounds exactly like cayenne.  Like the pepper and the porsche. 
### What is this?
This is my development environment for life and journal. Theres no filter. 

I care a lot about technology, living in flow state and good art. 

I am always obsessed with a person or an idea at all times and reading up about it. 

As a humanist it seems like all roads lead to building. 

Good ideas are the most important things in the entire universe.
