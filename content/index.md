Hey there. I'm Kyan. A 25 year old builder and closeted artist. 

My exotic ethnic name, Kyan, is pronounced exactly like 'cayenne'. I'm deeply interested in everything technology, the state of flow, and art, often finding myself engrossed in learning more about a person or an idea. Intriguingly, all my learnings often circle back to building. I believe that good ideas are the most important entities in the universe. 
### What is this?
Consider this my life's development environment and journal. I am making efforts to make this chapter of my life the chapter of focused feedback.
