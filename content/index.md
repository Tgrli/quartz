title: Thanks for being here

I'm Kyan, a builder living in Shanghai China but eager to live at the network school.

I try to get smarter by writing, but have trouble with sharing them here. Going though write of passage right now to fill this site up with banger essays in the future. 

I'm deeply interested in everything technology. At any given point of time, I'm probably obsessed about a person or an idea. Intriguingly, all my learnings often circle back to building. 
### What is this?
Consider this my life's development environment and playground for ideas. I am making efforts to make this chapter of my life [[focused feedback]]. Notes and essays here are always under construction.
