Hey there. I'm Kyan. A 25 year old builder and closeted artist.

My exotic ethnic name, Kyan, is pronounced exactly like 'cayenne'. I'm deeply interested in everything technology, the state of flow, and art, often finding myself engrossed in learning more about a person or an idea. Intriguingly, all my learnings often circle back to building. I believe that good ideas are the most important entities in the universe. Consider this my life's development environment and journal.
### What is this?
