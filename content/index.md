I'm Kyan, a 25 year old builder working on [[Mythril]] and [[Golflow]]. I try to get smarter by writing.

I'm deeply interested in everything technology. At any given point of time, I'm probably obsessed about a person or an idea. Intriguingly, all my learnings often circle back to building. I have come to believe that good ideas are the most important things in the universe. 
### What is this?
Consider this my life's development environment and playground for ideas. I am making efforts to make this chapter of my life [[focused feedback]]. Notes and essays here are always under construction. 
### Projects 
 1. [[Mythril]] is a world building game
 2. [[Golflow]] is a social network for golfers
 3. Diligen.ai is a due diligence tool (Sunsetting soon) [[lessons from building Diligen.Ai]]
