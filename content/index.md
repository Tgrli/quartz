Hey there. I'm Kyan. 

A 25 year old [[builder]] and closeted [[artist]]. 

My exotic ethnic name, Kyan, is pronounced exactly like 'cayenne'. 

I'm deeply interested in everything technology, and the state of flow. At any given point of time, I'm probably obsessed about a person or an idea. Intriguingly, all my learnings often circle back to building. I have come to believe that good ideas are the most important things in the universe. This is [[my story]] 

[[Reading List]]
### What is this?
Consider this my life's development environment and playground for ideas. I am making efforts to make this chapter of my life [[focused feedback]]. Notes and essays here are always under construction. I apologize in advance if you bump into some incomplete ideas.
### Projects 
 1. [[Mythril]] is a [[world building]] game
 2. [[Golflow]] is a social network for golfers
 3. Diligen.ai is a due diligence tool (Sunsetting soon) [[lessons from building Diligen.Ai]]

Here are some worthless [[business ideas]]
