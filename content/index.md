Hey there. I'm Kyan. 

A 25 year old [[builder]] and closeted [[artist]]. 

My exotic ethnic name, Kyan, is pronounced exactly like 'cayenne'. 

I'm deeply interested in everything technology, and the state of flow. At any given point of time, I'm probably obsessed about a person or an idea. Intriguingly, all my learnings often circle back to building. I have come to believe that good ideas are the most important things in the universe. This is [[my story]]
### What is this?
Consider this my life's development environment and journal. I am making efforts to make this chapter of my life the chapter of focused feedback. 

### Projects 
 1. [[Mythril]] is a [[world building]] game
 2. Diligen.ai is a due diligence tool (Sunsetting soon) [[What I learned building Diligen AI]]

### On Chain IDs
kyanli.btc kyanli.eth kyanli.sol
