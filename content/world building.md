World building is a raw form of creativity, imagination and generatively. Things we lack as adults but felt vicerally as children. I believe generativeness like courage is a muscle you can train. You use it or lose it. 

In a world full of products that put us in a default state of consumption. It's more important than ever to have products that are capable of countering it, and put us in a generative state. A state of action that can inspire agency. 

I find it a therapeutic experience in the sense that it can uncover the underlying scripts that run throughout lives.

[[Mythril]] is my attempt at building a tool that can facilitate a fun and intuitive world building experience.
