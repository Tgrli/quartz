title: Post Scarcity

 One of my favorite topics to think about because the smartest people are working towards this goal. I think If we don't nuke ourselves and keep having sex. We'll eventually reach post scarcity. 

What I think about postcards I'm thinking more in the individual sense not in the societal sense.  

I consider a person post scarcity if they are not driven by money or independently wealthy from childhood.
 
"Independently wealthy from childhood." I first heard this phrase in the book Talent by Tyler Cohen and Daniel Gross. The book wasn't focused on postcard per se. But it triggered a series of thought around the topic of post scarcity.  
 
It is such a neutral way to describe a rich kids. I mean. Don't we all want our children to be independently wealthy from childhood? Don't we want to give our children, the freedom of choice of which arena to compete in?
