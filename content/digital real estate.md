On my journey of trying hard to be a tech guy(learning about algorithms and data structures). At a point I realized If I cant take my data or network somewhere else I don't own it. If i don't own it its not ideal to spend my precious time on it. 

But here comes the dilemma. The biggest platforms are closed. So if you want ownership you have to sacrifice reach. My best answer to this using corporate networks strategically as a top of the funnel entry point for your own  is using a service like YUP to post to multiple platforms at the same time. 



My mind was opened when I heard Chris Dixon talk about digital real estate. I want to occupy a tiny corner of the web so i can do whatever i want on it. So now i have kyan.li kyanli.com.btc.eth.sol to ensure bottom layer ownership.
