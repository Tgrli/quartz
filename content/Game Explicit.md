The fewer secrets I have the more happy and calm my mind is. 

It is my way of saying focus. Making up terms like this for myself is a handy way to carve out my section of language to mean something for a specific thing. 

I tend to have better memory for these specific things I name. Game explicit is one of these terms I came up with. 

Here are the games  (meta game: input-output)

- Using and building tech
- Sports (golf, basketball, strength training)
- Music (enjoy it by consuming and playing it)
- Invest (Make decisions with resources according to my world model)
- Reading and Writing (input-output ideas)

I think if only spend time playing the previous set of games. I will compound insights and abilities, making my success inevitable.
